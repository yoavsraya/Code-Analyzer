    `### Design Patterns

- **Observer Pattern:**
  - **Classes: Game, Board, Player**
    - **Feedback:** Implement the Observer pattern to handle state changes and notifications between 'Game', 'Board', and 'Player'. This allows 'Player' and 'Board' to be updated when the game state changes, promoting a clean separation of concerns and improving scalability.

### Exception Handling

- **Error Handling:**
  - **Classes: Game, Board, Player**
    - **Feedback:** There's no mention of specific exception handling. Introduce custom exceptions specific to the game logic (e.g., InvalidMoveException) to handle invalid actions and ensure robust error management.

### SOLID Principles

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):**
  - **Classes: GameMainForm, GameSettingsForm**
    - **Feedback:** 
      - **GameMainForm:** Ensure it focuses only on the user interactions and not on game logic. Any game-related logic should be moved to the 'Game' class.
      - **GameSettingsForm:** Maintain this form's role strictly for handling game settings. Avoid merging it with game starting logic.

### Encapsulation and Accessibility

- **Accessibility Modifiers:**
  - **Classes: GameMainForm, Program**
    - **Feedback:** 
      - **GameMainForm:** Consider if it needs to be 'internal' or if 'public' is better for broader usability. In most cases, forms in .NET applications are 'public'.
      - **Program:** Check if 'public' is necessary. It could be 'internal' to restrict access within the appropriate assembly.

### Code Composition and Inheritance

- **Composition Over Inheritance:**
  - **Classes: GameMainForm, GameSettingsForm**
    - **Feedback:** Ensure that composition is used adequately instead of inheritance where applicable. For example, if 'GameSettingsForm' can be refactored to utilize more components without extending a form directly.

### Cohesion and Coupling

- **Low Coupling:**
  - **Classes and Relationships:** Game, Board, Player
    - **Feedback:** Maintain low coupling between 'Game', 'Board', and 'Player'. Ensure that modifying one class does not affect others significantly. Use interfaces and dependency injection where possible.

### Class Design Improvements

- **Polymorphism:**
  - **Classes: Player**
    - **Feedback:** If 'Player' involves different types (e.g., HumanPlayer, AIPlayer), leverage polymorphism to define a common interface or abstract class. This allows flexible and interchangeable player types.

### Aggregation and Composition

- **Class Relationships:**
  - **Classes: Game, Board, Player**
    - **Feedback:** 
      - **Game composition with 'Board' and 'Player':** Ensure 'Game' acts as an orchestrator without deep knowledge of the inner workings of 'Board' and 'Player'.
      - **Player aggregation with 'eBoardShape':** Make sure 'eBoardShape' is essential for the 'Player'â€™s role and that this aggregation does not complicate the class unnecessarily.

### User Interface Separation

- **MVC or MVP Pattern:**
  - **Classes: GameMainForm, GameSettingsForm, Game**
    - **Feedback:** Consider utilizing MVC (Model-View-Controller) or MVP (Model-View-Presenter) patterns to separate the UI logic (forms) from the game logic (model). This will make the application easier to maintain and test.`
